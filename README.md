# About the App

This app will allow the user to add staff to a database and delete them. I want to get used to passing props and functions down components, working with click events etc. 

## How the app works

I've used the JSON Server extension to simulate having a database so I can make actual HTTP requests. 

## What I want to learn from building this

This will give me a good chance to understand how props work and moving them up and down the application. The funcitonality of the app requires me to pass props & functions up and down the parent and child components. 

## Things left to do

- [ ] Add more form validation
    - [ ] The input for the dates have no set format, which I don't like. 
    - [ ] Add some functions to the input to make sure the text is all capitalise the same way.

- [ ] Add dashboarding functionality - I have left the bottom right portion of the screen empty for this.
    - [ ] Current salary spend.
    - [ ] Salary spend per capita.
    - [ ] Average age.

- [ ] Search functionality from the input bar
    - [x] Pass down function from the parent component to the SearchBar.js component.
    - [x] Get the input from the bar passed up to the app.js parent component.
    - [ ] Filter through the StaffMembers array and display these staff members when the user types and input.

- [ ] Add an edit function to the app.

Lots of things to keep me busy!
